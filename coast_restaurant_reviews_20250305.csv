5 stars,Have been coming up to Coast for many years. We’ve had many servers like Hondas and Daylen. As they left we still have Oscar. He’s been there for us early on and always remembers us. The food is fantastic and happy hour is unreal. Way better than earls and cactus. Come here if you want to have a good time and a friendly staff,12 hours ago,2025-03-05,02-Mar-2025 to 08-Mar-2025,,,,5,5,5,,,,

5 stars,"My hubby and I came in on a Saturday for happy hour with reservations.

Our server was Peter who immediately greeted us and offered us water.

We were so happy with his recommendation to get the calamari which was crispy and well seasoned.

Our beef carpaccio was delicious and had a small hiccup but Peter was quick to revolve the issue.

The oysters were so fresh and the shaved horseradish, cocktail sauce and mignonette go so well together.

Amazing, attentive and friendly service and top quality dishes at an excellent value will have us returning again and again!",a day ago,2025-03-04,02-Mar-2025 to 08-Mar-2025,Dine in,Other,$90–100,5,5,5,"Chef's Selection of Oysters, Wagyu Beef Carpaccio, Salt & Pepper Calamari",,,
