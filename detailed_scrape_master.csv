5 stars,"My friend and I had exceptional service from our server Sallie. She knew when to check in on us and when to leave us alone. Despite arriving late she honoured us with a Happy Hour priced drink, and when she found out that my friend’s son got engaged that day she came with glasses of bubbly! We were not big paying clients but she treated us just the same!

FOOD: appetizers were okay.
MAIN: fish n chips were kinda small for the price
Lobster pasta: small portion and not enough lobster
Steak: was terrible.  Very expensive for low quality meat that was overcooked and chewy.  Way better at THE KEG
SERVICE: was very good
ATMOSPHERE: also good.

OVERALL:  The whole reason was the main dish and we had 3 mains and we can get everything better elsewhere for way less",a day ago,2025-02-26,23-Feb-2025 to 01-Mar-2025,,,,1.0,5.0,4.0,,,,

5 stars,"An Unforgettable Dining Experience at Coast Vancouver! Saturday Feb 22/2025.

My husband and I had an absolutely exceptional date night at Coast on Saturday, February 22, before heading to the symphony. From the moment we arrived, we were treated like royalty! Katya, the amazing sommelier, ensured we had the best seat in the house and took the time to educate me on the incredible wine selections, food suggestions and making the evening even more special. Also being greeted with a delicious glass of cold, Prosecco was the perfect starter to a fabulous meal.

Our server, Caili, was outstanding—attentive, knowledgeable, funny and genuinely warm. The service was seamless, making us feel both valued and pampered.
We were attending the Vancouver Metropolitan Orchestra evening so we had to have dinner early. We didn’t realize we came in on happy hour and absolutely enjoyed the variety of delicious appetizers.

And the food? Absolutely divine! Every dish was crafted to perfection, showcasing the incredible skill and passion of the chefs. Kudos to them for creating such memorable food!

A special thank you to the general manager, who engaged with us and made sure everything was beyond perfect. The combination of incredible service, exquisite food, and a welcoming atmosphere made this one of the best dining experiences we've ever had. Katya and Caili truly exemplify excellence in hospitality, and we can't wait to return!

1 star,"We were here last night for the set-menu valentine dinner. Extremely disappointed. Looking at the reviews, I am glad that I am not the only one disappointed. The food was late, cold, the portion extremely disappointing for two people, and at the end we were forced to pay 18% gratuity fee for a mediocre service. The restaurant manager tried to be attentive and make it right, but this terrible set menu and the delays in bringing the food just left a bad taste in our mouth. The menu its self is misleading! It says King Crab Sushi ROLL, but they brought the smallest piece of sushi I have ever seen in my life, not even one bite! Then the main course on the menu it says Steak & Chilean Sea Bass, we were under the impression we will each get portions of both items since the menu clearly states that this menu is PER PERSON NOT SHARED! OMG how much misleading can this be Glowbal?!
I hope the Glowbal group head-chef/management team read these reviews and make it right to us people who left extremely disappointed last night. We trusted your brand and you guys took away the experience of one special night from us! Such a shame!",2 days ago,,16-Feb-2025 to 22-Feb-2025,,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,,

5 stars,"I had reserved a party of 5 on Jan 26. My party and I had gotten off work from the AM so some of us came slightly under dressed but were still graciously welcomed and brought to our table.
My party and I have been looking for places to eat in downtown as we work back of the house at a restaurant in Richmond. Our Server, Ben W, was excellent at taking care of us. Upon learning that we came all the way from Richmond looking for places to eat, he had suggestions for some places for us that are in the area. We took note of the places and added it to our list for the next time we come together in downtown.

The food and drinks, excellent. We had ordered the carpaccio, calamari and crab cake on top of ordering from the Lobster menu. Some of us added the surf and turf which was a 10oz striploin. The lobster louie, lobster roll, lobster thermidor, and lobster pasta came out perfectly. We found that the lobster was cooked perfectly and not chewy. Calamari was tender. Crabcake was great. The one thing that we were unsure of was the crostini for the carpaccio, the size and how thin wasnt our favorite but the carpaccio itself was great.  The banana&coconut cake  was a nice finishing touch to our dinner. We had stellas and they came in a chilled glass that were a game changer.

The atmosphere was a 10. Good vibe and all the tables around us seemed to be having a good time. Really happy with how the place looked and how good i felt being there.

1 star,"The lobster deal was too good to be true, don’t waste your money. The food was awful, especially the lobster was the most rubbery, overcooked thing I’ve ever had, and the pasta was so overcooked it felt like mashed potatoes. The dessert was mediocre at best. To top it off, I was seated right next to the restroom, which had people constantly coming in and out. The smell from the restroom fragrance was unbearable, and the bathroom itself was dirty. The only redeeming things were the rolls, which were pretty good, and the drink, which was decent. Overall, it’s just not worth it better to go somewhere else. Plus, the service is far from welcoming from the moment I walked in, server felt overwhelmed by all the tables she had.

Food was okay and service could have been better. The food came out at very different times, portion sizes weren’t consistent, and the meal in general was quite sloppy for a restaurant owned by the Glowbal.

I don’t blame the waitress but management needs to do better. The waitress was handling almost 10 tables to herself, way too many tables for one person during dinner time.

5 stars,"Recently my husband and I visited Coast for our 10 year anniversary. Needless to say we had a magical experience! We both love seafood and safe to say Coast delivered! Our handsome server Jacob gave us a warm welcome and spoiled us with his amazing service. This night couldn't have been better spent anywhere else, it was magic. As per Jacob's recommendation we enjoyed a fantastic bottle of wine, the delicious flatbread, along with delicious entrees. Highly recommend for a special night!

5 stars,"I have planned many corporate events here for lunch and dinner. Glowbal group continues to deliver top notch service, in addition, their event planning team communicates effectively, providing suggestions on menu items, and know how to make the experience special for business clients. I plan multiple events on a monthly basis and I do not always attend the events I plan, which can be stressful - with Glowbal Group, I know i do not need to worry. I've worked with Emma, Selina and Clea and they provide 10/10 service on logistics, set up, cocktail/mocktail ideas etc. On a personal note, outside of business, I dine at Glowbal restaurants often but Coast is my favourite!",a month ago,,January,,,,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,,

5 stars,"We had both a corporate dinner and a private dinner here before, and we had a wonderful experience on both occasions. The service was exceptional - very attentive and thoughtful.

One small suggestion for improvement would be for them to update or wash the patio cushions more regularly. We would recommend opting for indoor seating, as we noticed a smell from people smoking outside near the patio area.

Overall, we had a great time and would definitely recommend this place.",a month ago,,January,Dine in,Dinner,$100+,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,,
