Despite arriving late she honoured us with a Happy Hour priced drink, and when she found out that my friend’s son got engaged that day she came with glasses of bubbly! We were not big paying clients but she treated us just the same!

My husband. And I recently dined at Coast restaurant and I cannot say enough about the outstanding customer service I received.

Our server, Laura went above and beyond to ensure our experience was perfect. She was attentive, friendly, and incredibly knowledgeable about the menu, offering great recommendations that turned out to be absolutely delicious.

The atmosphere was warm and inviting, and it was clear that the staff genuinely cared about making our evening special.

2 stars,"Came here with my family and spent over $300 with tip.  Here’s my experience:

FOOD: appetizers were okay.
MAIN: fish n chips were kinda small for the price
Lobster pasta: small portion and not enough lobster
Steak: was terrible.  Very expensive for low quality meat that was overcooked and chewy.  Way better at THE KEG
SERVICE: was very good
ATMOSPHERE: also good.

OVERALL:  The whole reason was the main dish and we had 3 mains and we can get everything better elsewhere for way less",3 days ago,2025-02-26,23-Feb-2025 to 01-Mar-2025,,,,1,5,4,,,,

5 stars,"An Unforgettable Dining Experience at Coast Vancouver! Saturday Feb 22/2025.

My husband and I had an absolutely exceptional date night at Coast on Saturday, February 22, before heading to the symphony. From the moment we arrived, we were treated like royalty! Katya, the amazing sommelier, ensured we had the best seat in the house and took the time to educate me on the incredible wine selections, food suggestions and making the evening even more special. Also being greeted with a delicious glass of cold, Prosecco was the perfect starter to a fabulous meal.

Our server, Caili, was outstanding—attentive, knowledgeable, funny and genuinely warm. The service was seamless, making us feel both valued and pampered.
We were attending the Vancouver Metropolitan Orchestra evening so we had to have dinner early. We didn’t realize we came in on happy hour and absolutely enjoyed the variety of delicious appetizers.

And the food? Absolutely divine! Every dish was crafted to perfection, showcasing the incredible skill and passion of the chefs. Kudos to them for creating such memorable food!

A special thank you to the general manager, who engaged with us and made sure everything was beyond perfect. The combination of incredible service, exquisite food, and a welcoming atmosphere made this one of the best dining experiences we've ever had. Katya and Caili truly exemplify excellence in hospitality, and we can't wait to return!

Highly recommend Coast for an unforgettable dining experience!",4 days ago,2025-02-25,23-Feb-2025 to 01-Mar-2025,Dine in,Dinner,$50–60,5,5,5,"Sushi, Carpaccio, Hamachi",,,
