That said, the food didn’t quite live up to the hype. Happy hour options? Coast absolutely nails them every time—tasty, well-priced, and definitely worth it.

8,5,"Downtown adventures led us to Coast, one of Glowbal Group’s seafood spots. Since Glowbal restaurants rarely disappoint, we figured we’d give their Happy Hour menu a shot (because let’s be honest—good food at a discount tastes even better). We were tempted by the $75 lobster set, but discipline (and a love for variety) kept us focused on Happy Hour.

Here’s what two hungry adults and two semi-hungry kids devoured:
•	A dozen fresh oysters – Because one does not simply say no to oysters.
•	Crab Dip – A creamy, crabby delight.
•	Wagyu Beef Carpaccio – Thin, fancy, and melt-in-your-mouth good.
•	Mini Lobster and Prawn Roll – indeed, not that Mini.
•	1/2 lb Mussels – Half a pound of ocean goodness.
•	Truffle Fries – Because fries without truffle are just… fries.
•	Fish & Chips (from the main menu) – Obligatory seafood classic.
•	Desserts: Crème Brûlée, Warm Banana Coconut Buttermilk Cake, and New York Cheesecake – Because leaving room for dessert is a life philosophy.

The verdict? No mind-blowing surprises, but everything was well-executed and absolutely worth the Happy Hour pricing. The oysters were fresh, the fries were truffly, and the service was on point.

8,5,"Downtown adventures led us to Coast, one of Glowbal Group’s seafood spots. Since Glowbal restaurants rarely disappoint, we figured we’d give their Happy Hour menu a shot (because let’s be honest—good food at a discount tastes even better). We were tempted by the $75 lobster set, but discipline (and a love for variety) kept us focused on Happy Hour.

Here’s what two hungry adults and two semi-hungry kids devoured:
•	A dozen fresh oysters – Because one does not simply say no to oysters.
•	Crab Dip – A creamy, crabby delight.
•	Wagyu Beef Carpaccio – Thin, fancy, and melt-in-your-mouth good.
•	Mini Lobster and Prawn Roll – indeed, not that Mini.
•	1/2 lb Mussels – Half a pound of ocean goodness.
•	Truffle Fries – Because fries without truffle are just… fries.
•	Fish & Chips (from the main menu) – Obligatory seafood classic.
•	Desserts: Crème Brûlée, Warm Banana Coconut Buttermilk Cake, and New York Cheesecake – Because leaving room for dessert is a life philosophy.

The verdict? No mind-blowing surprises, but everything was well-executed and absolutely worth the Happy Hour pricing. The oysters were fresh, the fries were truffly, and the service was on point.

Would I go back? Absolutely. Would I still regret not ordering the lobster set?

My party and I have been looking for places to eat in downtown as we work back of the house at a restaurant in Richmond. Our Server, Ben W, was excellent at taking care of us. Upon learning that we came all the way from Richmond looking for places to eat, he had suggestions for some places for us that are in the area. We took note of the places and added it to our list for the next time we come together in downtown.

The food and drinks, excellent. We had ordered the carpaccio, calamari and crab cake on top of ordering from the Lobster menu. Some of us added the surf and turf which was a 10oz striploin. The lobster louie, lobster roll, lobster thermidor, and lobster pasta came out perfectly. We found that the lobster was cooked perfectly and not chewy. Calamari was tender. Crabcake was great. The one thing that we were unsure of was the crostini for the carpaccio, the size and how thin wasnt our favorite but the carpaccio itself was great.  The banana&coconut cake  was a nice finishing touch to our dinner. We had stellas and they came in a chilled glass that were a game changer.

251,5,"I had reserved a party of 5 on Jan 26. My party and I had gotten off work from the AM so some of us came slightly under dressed but were still graciously welcomed and brought to our table.
My party and I have been looking for places to eat in downtown as we work back of the house at a restaurant in Richmond. Our Server, Ben W, was excellent at taking care of us. Upon learning that we came all the way from Richmond looking for places to eat, he had suggestions for some places for us that are in the area. We took note of the places and added it to our list for the next time we come together in downtown.

The food and drinks, excellent. We had ordered the carpaccio, calamari and crab cake on top of ordering from the Lobster menu. Some of us added the surf and turf which was a 10oz striploin. The lobster louie, lobster roll, lobster thermidor, and lobster pasta came out perfectly. We found that the lobster was cooked perfectly and not chewy. Calamari was tender. Crabcake was great. The one thing that we were unsure of was the crostini for the carpaccio, the size and how thin wasnt our favorite but the carpaccio itself was great.  The banana&coconut cake  was a nice finishing touch to our dinner. We had stellas and they came in a chilled glass that were a game changer.

The atmosphere was a 10. Good vibe and all the tables around us seemed to be having a good time. Really happy with how the place looked and how good i felt being there.
