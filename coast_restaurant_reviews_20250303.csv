5 stars,"My hubby and I came in on a Saturday for happy hour with reservations.

Our server was Peter who immediately greeted us and offered us water.

We were so happy with his recommendation to get the calamari which was crispy and well seasoned.

Our beef carpaccio was delicious and had a small hiccup but Peter was quick to revolve the issue.

The oysters were so fresh and the shaved horseradish, cocktail sauce and mignonette go so well together.

Amazing, attentive and friendly service and top quality dishes at an excellent value will have us returning again and again!",14 hours ago,2025-03-03,02-Mar-2025 to 08-Mar-2025,Dine in,Other,$90–100,5,5,5,"Oysters on the Half Shell and Lemon Drop, Wagyu Beef Carpaccio, Calamari",,,

5 stars,"What a great place! From the moment we walked in, our waitress, Sallie, made us feel as if we had been a patron for years despite having only arrived from the UK the day before.
The atmosphere was very good and Sallie’s knowledge of the menu and her recommendations were excellent.
So good in fact that we have booked to go again tomorrow.

5 stars,"My friend and I had exceptional service from our server Sallie. She knew when to check in on us and when to leave us alone. Despite arriving late she honoured us with a Happy Hour priced drink, and when she found out that my friend’s son got engaged that day she came with glasses of bubbly! We were not big paying clients but she treated us just the same! Thank you Sallie for your exceptional service, I hope to see you again soon.",3 days ago,2025-02-28,23-Feb-2025 to 01-Mar-2025,,,,5,5,5,,,,
