5 stars,"Came by coast for a happy hour and highly recommend making a reso beforehand because it was sooo busy! Tried out a few of the menu items but unfortunately nothing was too impressive

Mussels - some were not as fresh as others. Thai sauce was good but wish all mussels were fresher

Wagyu carpaccio - it was ok, felt like there could have been more than 5 slices for the value but was pretty tasty

Calamari - fresh squid and liked the sauce that it came with

Crab dip - our fav of the night, very cheesy and tasty

Raspberry cake - so pretty and tasted as good as it looked",9 hours ago,2025-03-06,02-Mar-2025 to 08-Mar-2025,,,,5,5,5,,,,

3 stars,"The restaurant has a nice atmosphere. We went there for the oyster happy hour, but the oysters were smaller than expected, which was a bit disappointing. There seemed to be a lot of servers; some provided good service, while others were just average.

5 stars,Have been coming up to Coast for many years. Weâ€™ve had many servers like Hondas and Daylen. As they left we still have Oscar. Heâ€™s been there for us early on and always remembers us. The food is fantastic and happy hour is unreal. Way better than earls and cactus. Come here if you want to have a good time and a friendly staff,a day ago,2025-03-05,02-Mar-2025 to 08-Mar-2025,,,,5,5,5,,,,

5 stars,"My hubby and I came in on a Saturday for happy hour with reservations.

Our server was Peter who immediately greeted us and offered us water.

We were so happy with his recommendation to get the calamari which was crispy and well seasoned.

Our beef carpaccio was delicious and had a small hiccup but Peter was quick to revolve the issue.

The oysters were so fresh and the shaved horseradish, cocktail sauce and mignonette go so well together.

Amazing, attentive and friendly service and top quality dishes at an excellent value will have us returning again and again!",2 days ago,2025-03-04,02-Mar-2025 to 08-Mar-2025,Dine in,Other,$90â€“100,5,5,5,"Chef's Selection of Oysters, Wagyu Beef Carpaccio, Salt & Pepper Calamari",,,
