5 stars,"My hubby and I came in on a Saturday for happy hour with reservations.

Our server was Peter who immediately greeted us and offered us water.

We were so happy with his recommendation to get the calamari which was crispy and well seasoned.

Our beef carpaccio was delicious and had a small hiccup but Peter was quick to revolve the issue.

The oysters were so fresh and the shaved horseradish, cocktail sauce and mignonette go so well together.

Amazing, attentive and friendly service and top quality dishes at an excellent value will have us returning again and again!",22 hours ago,2025-03-04,02-Mar-2025 to 08-Mar-2025,Dine in,Other,$90–100,5,5,5,"Chef's Selection of Oysters, Wagyu Beef Carpaccio, Salt & Pepper Calamari",,,
