17,5,"My hubby and I came in on a Saturday for happy hour with reservations.

Our server was Peter who immediately greeted us and offered us water.

We were so happy with his recommendation to get the calamari which was crispy and well seasoned.

Our beef carpaccio was delicious and had a small hiccup but Peter was quick to revolve the issue.

The oysters were so fresh and the shaved horseradish, cocktail sauce and mignonette go so well together.

Also being greeted with a delicious glass of cold, Prosecco was the perfect starter to a fabulous meal.

Our server, Caili, was outstanding—attentive, knowledgeable, funny and genuinely warm. The service was seamless, making us feel both valued and pampered.

Katya, the amazing sommelier, ensured we had the best seat in the house and took the time to educate me on the incredible wine selections, food suggestions and making the evening even more special. Also being greeted with a delicious glass of cold, Prosecco was the perfect starter to a fabulous meal.

Our server, Caili, was outstanding—attentive, knowledgeable, funny and genuinely warm. The service was seamless, making us feel both valued and pampered.
We were attending the Vancouver Metropolitan Orchestra evening so we had to have dinner early. We didn’t realize we came in on happy hour and absolutely enjoyed the variety of delicious appetizers.

And the food? Absolutely divine! Every dish was crafted to perfection, showcasing the incredible skill and passion of the chefs. Kudos to them for creating such memorable food!

230,5,"I had reserved a party of 5 on Jan 26. My party and I had gotten off work from the AM so some of us came slightly under dressed but were still graciously welcomed and brought to our table.
My party and I have been looking for places to eat in downtown as we work back of the house at a restaurant in Richmond. Our Server, Ben W, was excellent at taking care of us. Upon learning that we came all the way from Richmond looking for places to eat, he had suggestions for some places for us that are in the area. We took note of the places and added it to our list for the next time we come together in downtown.

The food and drinks, excellent. We had ordered the carpaccio, calamari and crab cake on top of ordering from the Lobster menu. Some of us added the surf and turf which was a 10oz striploin. The lobster louie, lobster roll, lobster thermidor, and lobster pasta came out perfectly. We found that the lobster was cooked perfectly and not chewy. Calamari was tender. Crabcake was great. The one thing that we were unsure of was the crostini for the carpaccio, the size and how thin wasnt our favorite but the carpaccio itself was great.  The banana&coconut cake  was a nice finishing touch to our dinner. We had stellas and they came in a chilled glass that were a game changer.

The atmosphere was a 10. Good vibe and all the tables around us seemed to be having a good time. Really happy with how the place looked and how good i felt being there.
