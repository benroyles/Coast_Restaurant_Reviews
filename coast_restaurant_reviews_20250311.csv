4 stars,"If you’re looking for a vibrant place to unwind yet receive excellent service, Coast is the place to be. The staff truly works hard to deliver top-notch hospitality, and it shows. They're easily one of the most harmonious and hardworking teams I've seen at a Glowbal chain.

That said, the food didn’t quite live up to the hype. Happy hour options? Coast absolutely nails them every time—tasty, well-priced, and definitely worth it. But the main courses seemed to fall short. The scallops with risotto were a bit too salty and, over time, felt like a bit of a chore to finish. The sablefish, while buttery and flavorful at first, became underwhelming. We were celebrating an anniversary (not a birthday), and it would've been a nice touch if they offered a dessert, like their neighbor Black & Blue does for special occasions. No fault of theirs, as they are generally quite busy, but it would’ve been a small gesture to help make the experience feel warmer and more memorable.

Still, Coast remains a top choice for happy hour in the city—bustling with fantastic service.",10 hours ago,2025-03-11,09-Mar-2025 to 15-Mar-2025,Dine in,Dinner,$40–50,4,5,5,,,,

5 stars,"Downtown adventures led us to Coast, one of Glowbal Group’s seafood spots. Since Glowbal restaurants rarely disappoint, we figured we’d give their Happy Hour menu a shot (because let’s be honest—good food at a discount tastes even better). We were tempted by the $75 lobster set, but discipline (and a love for variety) kept us focused on Happy Hour.

Here’s what two hungry adults and two semi-hungry kids devoured:
•	A dozen fresh oysters – Because one does not simply say no to oysters.
•	Crab Dip – A creamy, crabby delight.
•	Wagyu Beef Carpaccio – Thin, fancy, and melt-in-your-mouth good.
•	Mini Lobster and Prawn Roll – indeed, not that Mini.
•	1/2 lb Mussels – Half a pound of ocean goodness.
•	Truffle Fries – Because fries without truffle are just… fries.
•	Fish & Chips (from the main menu) – Obligatory seafood classic.
•	Desserts: Crème Brûlée, Warm Banana Coconut Buttermilk Cake, and New York Cheesecake – Because leaving room for dessert is a life philosophy.

The verdict? No mind-blowing surprises, but everything was well-executed and absolutely worth the Happy Hour pricing. The oysters were fresh, the fries were truffly, and the service was on point.

Would I go back? Absolutely. Would I still regret not ordering the lobster set? Also yes.",2 days ago,2025-03-09,09-Mar-2025 to 15-Mar-2025,Dine in,Dinner,$50–60,4,5,5,,,,

5 stars,"Fabulous birthday dinner at COAST !
We requested a quiet table and were seated upstairs overlooking the restaurant which was ideal. Our server Jesse was great, totally informed, attentive and fun. Katya, our lovely sommelier had the perfect suggestion to complement our meal.
We tried several dishes and were pleasantly impressed. Highly recommend the crab cakes and the prawn dish with red curry coconut soba noodles. SO GOOD !
Other staff attending our table were pleasant and efficient which was very much appreciated. The “Happy Birthday” dessert was a sweet surprise.
COAST dinner menu is extensive and we already have in mind some dishes to try on our next visit. Thanks to all, we had a wonderful experience and will definitely be returning !",3 days ago,2025-03-08,02-Mar-2025 to 08-Mar-2025,Dine in,Dinner,$100+,5,5,5,,,,

5 stars,"Came by coast for a happy hour and highly recommend making a reso beforehand because it was sooo busy! Tried out a few of the menu items but unfortunately nothing was too impressive

Mussels - some were not as fresh as others. Thai sauce was good but wish all mussels were fresher

Wagyu carpaccio - it was ok, felt like there could have been more than 5 slices for the value but was pretty tasty

Calamari - fresh squid and liked the sauce that it came with

Crab dip - our fav of the night, very cheesy and tasty

Raspberry cake - so pretty and tasted as good as it looked",5 days ago,2025-03-06,02-Mar-2025 to 08-Mar-2025,,,,5,5,5,,,,
